### What's this about?

Hi there! Welcome to this archive where I display some of my creative works which I make in my freetime. Hope you'll have a good time!

### What all I've got?

Here's how my works are categorised:

1. Posters
2. Wallpapers
3. Logo
4. Digital Art
5. Mandala Art

### How to?

Each category has its own Markdown file (.md extension file) in the [**GitHub Repository**](https://github.com/shrutilicensed/DESIGN-WORK-BY-SHRUTI-CHOUDHARY-). Just open them and you can view the work I've enclosed in each of them!
