3. This was actually a submission for a poster making competition organized by Drishti Media Society of DSW Manav Rachna. The task was to make a poster on the same. I was the Runner Up and was prized with Canva Pro.

4. I re-did the poster after I received my Canva Pro. I did it only for fun, from making a clone of their logo to the whole thing itself.
