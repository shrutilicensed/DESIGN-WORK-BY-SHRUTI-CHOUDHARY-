# Digital Art by Shruti

All of the artworks are made on **mobile phone**
and **_without_** using a stylus. I started this journey by tracing things but later on I've grown enough to make art without tracing at all.

Initially I used PicsArt but then I started using IbisPaintX.

1. Megumi Fushiguro from Jujutsu Kaisen. I traced this on PicsArt.

3. Miyazono Kaori from Your Lie In April. I traced this on IbisPaintX as well. The eyes took very long.

4. Naruto and Sasuke from Naruto. I traced this from a black and white manga panel and coloured it from my own memory.

5. Hinata Shoyou from Haikyuu. I traced the main character and Japanese kanji letters (which translates as "fly"). Later I edited it over the sky.

9. Shinei Nouzen from Eigthy Six. I traced this guy from the black and white illustration provided in the light novel. The sky and the colours are done by me.
